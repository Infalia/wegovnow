*Trusted Marketplace for WeGovNow* (TMP) was replaced by [Offers & Requests](https://infalia.github.io/wegovnow/wgn-offers-requests)

Trusted Marketplace is composed of the following sub-systems: 

1) The "Social Accounts Linker" for collecting personal posts  
2) The "Reputation Mechanism" to analyse the collected data from the "Social Accounts Linker" and set user's reputation score  
3) The "Enhanced User Profile" to be used for better match-making  
4) The "Accessibility Preferences" (part of the "Enhanced User Profile")  
5) The "Offers and Demands" (the ancestor of the future "Offers & Requests")  
6) The "Personalised Timeline" (which is moved in the "WeGovNow Landing Page")  

The following screenshot shows how users can link their social accounts through the Enhanced User Profile. At any time, users are able to disable one or all social accounts and stop the data collection from their account(s).
