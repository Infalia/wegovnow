            <hr>
            <p>This guide briefly presents the project outcomes by the INFALIA team.</p>
            <p>The guide contains a collection of all the components, plugins, modules and tools implemented for the WeGovNow project by INFALIA.</p>
<p>The purpose of this repository is to provide to the community a reference point to help them <strong>reuse the outcomes</strong> but also to <strong>include new 3rd party platforms</strong> to the WeGovNow ecosystem, thus helping WeGovNow to scale-up with new tools and solutions.</p>
<p>This guide, focuses to administrators who wish to install the two major outcomes, namely the ImproveMyCity and the Offers & Requests (former Trusted Marketplace) components. Trusted Marketplace, including the reputation mechanism and the social network accounts integration, although not piloted during the project duration, can also be found in this repository.</p>

<p>The source code, but also instructions on how to install and setup the tools are also available.</p>
